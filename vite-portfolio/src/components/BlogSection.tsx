    title: "My Very First Co-op ü´£üò¨",
    excerpt:
      "This experience not only introduced me to the fundamentals of web development but also sparked a passion for inclusive design.",
    content: `Starting my first co-op as part of the Quality Assurance (QA) Developer team has been a whirlwind of learning, adapting, and gaining 
    hands-on experience in software testing. Like most first-time experiences, I was both excited and a little nervous, not fully knowing 
    what to expect. But as I got into the flow, I realized that QA dev is so much more than simply finding bugs‚Äîit‚Äôs about building reliable 
    systems, ensuring user satisfaction, and working closely with the entire development team to create high-quality software. Here‚Äôs a closer 
    look at what my day-to-day looks like, the testing environments I work in, and some of the key QA practices I‚Äôve picked up along the way.

    In QA, testing isn‚Äôt just done in one place. We work across three distinct environments: Dev, QA/Beta, and Live‚Äîeach with its own purpose and requirements.

    1. Dev (Development Environment): This is where it all begins. Developers make changes here first, testing their work on local branches before merging them 
    into Dev. For major updates, additional testing is done early in Dev to catch potential issues before they impact other environments. As a QA developer, 
    I often keep an eye on these early changes, ensuring any problems are flagged quickly.

    2. QA/Beta Environment: Once changes look stable in Dev, they‚Äôre released to the QA or Beta environment. Here, I can test the app as if it‚Äôs close to release,
    which gives a more accurate picture of how features and updates will perform in the real world. It‚Äôs our chance to find issues that may not have surfaced 
    in Dev, allowing us to fine-tune before it goes live.

    3. Live Environment: Finally, changes make their way to the Live environment, where clients interact with the app. We typically release updates to Live about 
    once a week, or twice per sprint. It‚Äôs essential to run regression and smoke tests after each merge to confirm that everything is functioning as expected, 
    both in new features and existing functionality.

    This structured approach to environments has taught me a lot about the stages of development and the importance of thorough testing at every stage. 
    Each environment builds on the last, creating layers of checks and balances that help maintain a high-quality product.

    Every day on the QA team is a little different, but there‚Äôs always a consistent rhythm to the work. Most mornings start with me reviewing the project 
    board on Azure DevOps. This board is like our central hub, tracking each feature, bug, and task in the current sprint. As soon as a developer marks 
    a feature as complete, it‚Äôs my job to jump in and manually test it to provide immediate feedback. Quick testing and feedback are essential, as they 
    help developers make timely adjustments and keep the project moving forward.

    In between these immediate tasks, I get to work on automation. When there aren‚Äôt new features or bug fixes to test, I spend time building out 
    automated integration and API tests. Automation is a big focus in our QA team‚Äîit allows us to streamline repetitive tests and get faster, 
    consistent results. Additionally, we hold regular team testing sessions to brainstorm, identify bugs, and collaborate on complex testing 
    scenarios. This balance between manual testing and automation has shown me the value of adaptability and how both approaches complement 
    each other to create a robust testing process.\n
    
    Our QA process includes daily pipeline runs that automatically test key areas of the application. Each pipeline run generates a 
    JUnit report that provides a summary of which tests passed, which failed, and details about the build. The report is sent via 
    email to QA team members and stakeholders, who review the results and address any failures. This automation has taught me the 
    importance of efficiency and consistency in testing, as it allows us to maintain quality standards with minimal manual intervention.\n
    
    Looking back on my first co-op experience, I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to dive into the world of quality assurance. 
    Working in QA has shown me that software testing is not just about finding bugs‚Äîit‚Äôs about building a product that people can trust. 
    It‚Äôs about paying attention to detail, thinking critically, and always considering the end user‚Äôs experience.

    Through daily testing, automation, and Agile ceremonies, I‚Äôve gained valuable skills and a new perspective on software development. 
    I‚Äôve learned the importance of communication, the power of collaboration, and the impact of a well-organized testing process. 
    This experience has laid a strong foundation for my future career, and I‚Äôm excited to carry these lessons forward as 
    I continue to grow in the field of software development.`,

    title: "My Experience as a Software Quality Analyst at Sonova ü¶ªüë®‚Äçüíª",
    excerpt:
      "Reflecting on my co-op placement and the valuable skills I gained in the hearing aid industry.",
    content: `During my 4-month co-op placement at Sonova as a Software Quality Analyst (SQA), 
    I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of hearing aid technology and software testing. 
    This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me a new perspective on the impact of technology in healthcare.

    Sonova is a global leader in innovative hearing care solutions: 
    from personal audio devices and wireless communication systems to 
    audiological care services, hearing aids and cochlear implants. 
    The Group was founded in 1947 and is headquartered in St√§fa, Switzerland.
    My co-op placement was at Unitron Canada, which is one of the branches of Sonova. 
    Unitron is a hearing aid manufacturer with worldwide operations headquartered 
    in Kitchener. Essentially, the company is the responsible for managing all the 
    hearing aid products, apps and accessories it manufactures. From my point of view,
    Sonova is a great first introduction to the Software Quality Assurance.

    It might seem tricky at start because of all the myriad products and services 
    they provide but you eventially adapt and learn. However, the company culture 
    is very cohesive. The reason for that being the size of the teams which are small 
    enough so you feel part of the team and you get to know everyone ultimately. 
    The SQA team composes of 12 people and we work closely with the fitting software
    team which is made of Software Developers and they have 14 people on their team. 
    Moreover, the social committee makes sure to host events for the employees every 
    once in a while so that we can get away from the tense work stress.\n
    
    As part of my co-op placement, I set out learning goals that I could achieve 
    throughout my time at Sonova. I set three goals that I think will help me 
    become a better and thriving Software Developer in the future. Working on 
    these goals have repeatedly kept me on track and helped me to stay focus 
    during my placement. Below I demonstrate what my goals were and how I achieved them.

    1. Oral Communication
    The number one goal was to communicate with software developers and managers to 
    ensure my testing was accurate and meaningful. My action plan was to improve on 
    my interpersonal skills during daily huddles and one on one meetings. This was a 
    task that changes with different software. As I became more familiar with each 
    program I tested, it became easier to gage my accuracy and meaning. I have not
    had a bug report denied because the bug was a known issue or not an issue at all. 
    A good measure of success for this primary goal was that that the issues found 
    were meaningful and the tests I ran were being executed accurately.

    2. Depth & Breadth of Understanding
    The second goal was to have an overall understanding of how other departments 
    worked and how they operated through the whole software cycle. My action plan 
    was to learn about other departments during my time in the company and whenever
    we had dedicated learning time which was dedicated time to learn about other 
    things that could be related to work or not. The measure of my success of this 
    secondary was to know how other departments operate after my time at Sonova. 
    I think it is important to not overlook the different aspects of the company.

    3. Problem Solving
    The third goal would be to improve on problem solving skills and citical thinking
    This allowed me to solve any bugs or issues related to my program. 
    Moreover, critical thinking applies to real world situations as well. 
    My action plan for this goal was to follow some steps methodically every 
    time there was some problem to solve. The steps to follow would be to:

    - Identify the problem \n
    - Do research\n
    - Gather solutions to the problem\n
    - Find the best solution\n
    - Apply the solution to the problem\n

    A measure of success for this goal was to solve problems 
    methodically and in a timely way. Problems can have different 
    level of diffculty so having a game plan is more efficient and not waste resources.\n
    
    My term spent at Sonova this Fall has been an incredible experience. I was able 
    to have a deeper view of how hearing aids work and also understand the multiple 
    concept surrounding hearing loss. I was able to contribute to projects that help 
    make a real difference in in the world. I was also lucky to learn about myriad of 
    new technologies that are are in production and some that have been recently launched. 
    In the end I was able to meet most of my goals I have set myself in the beginning of the term. 
    Between the learning goals I have achieved and the projects I have worked on, I gained a lot 
    during this term, both in skill set and experience. That being said, I hope you have enjoyed 
    reading this post and you are as intrigued as I was about hearing aids!`,

    My Experience and What I Learned:\n

    At the beginning of my co-op, I established several learning objectives to guide my progress and help me grow as a 
    future Software Developer. These goals have been instrumental in keeping me focused and motivated, and I‚Äôd like to 
    share how each of these objectives has shaped my experience at IJS.

    Oral Communication - 
    One of my primary goals was to enhance my oral communication skills, especially when interacting with software 
    developers and managers. Clear communication is essential in QA, as it ensures that my testing efforts are understood 
    and valued by the team. To meet this goal, I actively participated in daily huddles and one-on-one meetings, where I 
    provided updates on my progress and discussed any testing insights. Over time, I became more familiar with each 
    software program I tested, allowing me to communicate test results and bug reports more confidently. I‚Äôm proud to say 
    that none of my bug reports were rejected as irrelevant, which I see as a testament to the quality of my work and my 
    ability to communicate effectively.

    Problem Solving - 
    Another key goal was to improve my problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. In QA, problem-solving 
    goes beyond identifying bugs; it‚Äôs about finding efficient, structured approaches to tackle challenges. 
    I developed a systematic method to approach issues, which involves recognizing and defining the problem, 
    conducting thorough research, compiling potential solutions, and then implementing the best option. 
    This structured approach has been invaluable in managing the variety of issues I‚Äôve encountered. 
    It‚Äôs also an efficient way to avoid wasting time and resources, as I can tackle problems systematically and resolve 
    them quickly.

    Teamwork - 
    Finally, I aimed to enhance my teamwork skills. Successful software development requires collaboration, as 
    everyone‚Äôs contributions need to align toward a common goal. I worked on improving my ability to collaborate 
    effectively by understanding both the shared objectives of the team and my specific responsibilities within that 
    framework. I found that establishing strong connections with both the Development (Dev) and Quality Assurance (QA) 
    teams was essential to this goal. By understanding each team‚Äôs priorities, I was able to contribute to a smooth 
    workflow and work collaboratively toward our shared goals.

    A Day in the Life of a Software Developer in Test\n
    In my role as a Software Developer in Test at IJS, I primarily focused on automating the VIEW web application, 
    along with writing inline tests. At the start of the term, my supervisor and I set ambitious goals to automate 
    50% of the system within four months. This was a challenging task, as our regression test suite consisted of over
    150 test tickets. However, I understood the value of automating these tests, as they would significantly reduce 
    repetitive manual work and provide faster feedback within the continuous development process.

    My day usually began with a scrum meeting, where the team discussed our progress, any blockers, and other 
    sprint-related issues. This daily stand-up helped keep us aligned and provided a space for immediate problem-solving. 
    Throughout the day, I worked on test automation and, whenever necessary, performed manual inline tests to ensure 
    quality. If I discovered any issues during testing, I reported them to the development team using our bug-tracking 
    tool, Jira. Writing clear and concise bug reports became essential for effective communication and faster resolution 
    of issues. Additionally, we had other scheduled meetings, such as sprint planning, sprint retrospectives, and 
    exploratory testing sessions, which added structure and rhythm to our week.

    What, When, and Why of Regression Testing\n
    What: Regression testing is essential to confirm that new code changes do not negatively impact the existing 
    functionality of the application.

    When: Ideally, regression tests should be run as frequently as possible. In our case, we aimed to run automated 
    regression tests after each code change to catch issues early.

    Why: Regular regression testing helps mitigate risks and allows the team to catch bugs in real-time as code 
    evolves. By continuously testing, we ensure that new features don‚Äôt break or compromise the application‚Äôs stability.

    Prioritization ‚Äì Which Tests to Automate?\n
    When automating tests, it‚Äôs crucial to focus on areas with the highest impact on the application. This includes 
    areas that require repetitive testing, are tedious to test manually, or are particularly vulnerable to errors. 
    Main functions of the application and error-prone features are always prioritized in the automation process.

    Writing and Running CodeceptJS Tests\n
    One of the tools I used during my time at IJS was CodeceptJS, an automated testing framework written in JavaScript. 
    CodeceptJS was our go-to tool for performing regression and Verification & Validation (V&V) testing on the VIEW 
    system. Despite my initial unfamiliarity with JavaScript, I quickly picked up enough to write and execute tests in 
    CodeceptJS effectively. Learning to use this tool has been a rewarding experience, as it not only improved my coding 
    skills but also allowed me to contribute to a faster, more efficient testing process.

    Reflecting on My Co-op Experience\n
    My summer work term at IJS has been an extraordinary journey. I gained a deep understanding of computer-aided 
    surgery and the role of technology in orthopedic procedures. Working at a company dedicated to making a positive 
    impact on patients‚Äô lives has been incredibly rewarding. Alongside my personal achievements, I had the chance to 
    work with emerging technologies and make meaningful contributions to projects that genuinely matter.

    Reflecting on the goals I set at the beginning of the term, I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. I enhanced my 
    communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills while actively participating in projects that strengthened my
    understanding of software testing. This experience has been invaluable, and I leave with a solid foundation in QA 
    and a newfound appreciation for the world of joint replacement surgery. I hope you enjoyed reading about my journey 
    and found it as fascinating as I did!`,
